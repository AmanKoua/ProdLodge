- For the audioNodes, allow the first subArray (that is not the audioSourceNodeBuffer)
  to only contain 2 items. all other "rows" can contain up to 3 item. This will allow
  it to align with the audioModules array (representative of the cards displayed by 
  the audioModules).

- To delete an audioModule / audioNode. First, the delete button is clicked. delete
  the audioModule form the audioModules array. Delete the audioNode from the audioNodes
  array. If after deletion, the subarray is empty, delete the subarrray. Else, ensure that 
  there are no gaps in the subarray. This logic has to be implemented differently for each
  module.

- To enable / disable an audiOnde, simply connect to the audioNode that is next (use
  continue in the connectAudioNodes effect essentially).

How to enable multiple Tracks 

- For each track, there will be a set of audioModules. When a user clicks a track, the audioModules
  will switch in the expanded audioBox area

- Each audioSettings track needs setAudioModules (to change modules), a copy of the audioModulesJSON arr
  to change by reference. Might need a currentSelectedTrack state variable in order to keep track of 
  which track is selected (to save the current audioModules configuration between track changed).

- For the audioNodes, have a system where each "chain" is always playing, resetting, stopping, etc,
  but the only thing that determines whether or not it is audible is the enable / disable settings 
  from the settings drawer. This will be achieved via gain node that is set to 0 or normal volume.

  Current audioNodes structure - audioNodes: AudioNode[][] (2d arr)
  [
    [AudioBufferSourceNode]
    [Node, Node] (maximum of 2 audioNodes)
    [Node, Node, Node] (max of 3 audioNodes)
    ....... (as many layers as desired)
    [AnalyserNode] (will always be the last node)
  ]

  Proposed audioNodes structure - audioNodes: AudioNode[][][] (3d arr)
  [
    [
      [...]  
    ],
    [
      [AudioBufferSourceNode]
      [Node, Node] (maximum of 2 audioNodes)
      [Node, Node, Node] (max of 3 audioNodes)
      ...... (as many layers as desired)
      [gainNode] (to control track enable / disable setting)
    ],
    [
      [...]  
    ],
    ....
  ]

  AnalyserNode (kept independent and seperate from audioNodes structure, as it will never change!)

  Current audioModules structure (audioModules will be saved and swapped out as JSON objects):

    [
      [Blank, Module, Module], (max of 3 modules, 1 MUST be the blank module)
      [module, module, module],
      [...]
    ]

Deployment Notes:

Frontend: 
  
  Change tailwind config to ensure tree-shaking is enabled. then run npm run build-css.
  run npm run build and build the react app to the dist folder. Copy the dist folder to
  the root of the backend folder. Everything should be good to go!

  Note: The app engine instance will fail to create files if you do not use {recursive: true}
  when creating files / directories. Other than that, it seems to work flawlessly.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Implementing react-locomotive-scroll

  the locomotive-scroll and react-locomotive-scroll dependencies need to be specified in the frontend's 
  package.json. 

  make sure to inclide "import "locomotive-scroll/dist/locomotive-scroll.css";" at the top level of the 
  component where locomotiveScrollProvider is used.

  Ensure that the scrollable element has "data-scroll-container" within it's attributes.

  It seems that one needs to manually refresh the page in order for locomotive-scroll changes
  to take effect.

  Using <React.StrictMode> will cause locomotive scroll to glitch out and create multiple scroll bars
  when navigating betweeen different pages!

  Lastly, ensure that the minimum height of the element is large enough to require a scrollbar (otherwise
  no scrollbar will appear!)

  Landing page deployment issues:

    - Desktop, 125% zoom, vertical layout (small width). Some cards titles get cut off. Most importantly,
      the "Message from the creator" section is cut off at the bottom.

    - Mobile, horizontal, non-desktop mode. Has very similar issues to the point made above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current bugs to fix:
  -Refreshing a page that is not the home results in error.
  -Clicking on a friend's profile that is not yet set.
  -Locomotive scroll messing up scrolling accross the entire application.
      
        Locomotive scroll is messing up the scrolling on other routes, because
        when accessed the web page, it goes to the landing page, before switching
        routes to the home route, for instance.
