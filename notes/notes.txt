- For the audioNodes, allow the first subArray (that is not the audioSourceNodeBuffer)
  to only contain 2 items. all other "rows" can contain up to 3 item. This will allow
  it to align with the audioModules array (representative of the cards displayed by 
  the audioModules).

- To delete an audioModule / audioNode. First, the delete button is clicked. delete
  the audioModule form the audioModules array. Delete the audioNode from the audioNodes
  array. If after deletion, the subarray is empty, delete the subarrray. Else, ensure that 
  there are no gaps in the subarray. This logic has to be implemented differently for each
  module.

- To enable / disable an audiOnde, simply connect to the audioNode that is next (use
  continue in the connectAudioNodes effect essentially).
